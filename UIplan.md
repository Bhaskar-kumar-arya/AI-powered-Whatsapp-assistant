# Project Phoenix: AI WhatsApp Client - UI/UX Design Plan

---

## 1. Vision & Core Philosophy

This document outlines the UI/UX design for a custom WhatsApp desktop client built with Electron. The primary goal is to create a powerful productivity tool that leverages a modular, conversational AI to enhance the standard chatting experience.

### Core Design Principles

* **Familiarity First:** The core chat experience will be immediately intuitive to any existing WhatsApp user. We will not reinvent the wheel for standard features.
* **Unobtrusive AI:** The AI will function as an accessible "co-pilot," readily available when needed but never cluttering the primary interface.
* **Clear Visual Language:** A distinct visual style (colors, icons) will be used for all AI-generated content and suggestions, ensuring the user can always differentiate between human and AI actions.

## 2. High-Level Architecture: The Three-Pane Layout

The application will use a three-pane layout, a proven pattern for productivity-focused desktop applications. This structure provides a clear separation of concerns and allows for a rich, uncluttered user experience.

```

\+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------+
|      [PANE 1]        |             [PANE 2]                |        [PANE 3]         |
|                      |                                     |                         |
|  Chat List &         |         Conversation View           |   AI Co-pilot Panel     |
|  Navigation          |                                     |   (Context-aware)       |
|                      |                                     |                         |
\+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------+

## 3. Component Breakdown

### Pane 1: Chat List & Navigation

This pane is the main navigation hub, providing an overview of all conversations with subtle AI enhancements.

* **Features:**
    * Standard vertical list of chats (Profile Picture, Name, Last Message, Timestamp).
    * Global Search Bar at the top.
    * Filter buttons: `All`, `Unread`, `Groups`, `AI Activity`.
* **AI Enhancements:**
    * **AI Indicators:** A small sparkle icon (✨) will appear next to chats where the AI has pending activity (e.g., a scheduled task, a drafted reply). The color can vary by activity type.

### Pane 2: Conversation View

This is the primary chat interface where the user reads and sends messages. AI interactions here are contextual and initiated by the user.

* **Chat Header:**
    * Displays Contact/Group name and status.
    * Includes a prominent **"Summarize Chat"** button.
* **Message Bubbles:**
    * On hover, a small AI icon (✨) appears.
    * Clicking the icon reveals a context menu:
        * `Draft reply to this`
        * `Create task from this message`
        * `Summarize since this message`
* **Message Input Box:**
    * **AI Button (✨):** After typing a message, clicking this button offers options like `Improve Writing`, `Change Tone`, or `Translate`.
    * **/ Commands:** Typing `/` will trigger a command menu for power users (e.g., `/summarize`, `/draft`, `/schedule`).

### Pane 3: AI Co-pilot Panel

This is the AI command center. It's a persistent, context-aware panel that serves as the primary interface for the AI assistant.

* **Tabs:**
    * **Co-pilot (Default):** A conversational chat interface to interact with the AI.
    * **Summary:** Displays detailed, structured summaries generated by the AI.
    * **Tasks:** Lists all tasks created from conversations.
    * **Drafts:** Shows AI-suggested replies, awaiting user review and approval.
    * **Functions:** The control panel for the modular AI, allowing the user to enable/disable AI capabilities.

## 4. AI Interaction Model: Conversational Co-pilot

The primary method of interacting with the AI will be through the **Co-pilot** chat tab in Pane 3.

* **Natural Language Prompts:** Users can type requests in plain English (e.g., "Remind me to call Sarah tomorrow morning").
* **Function Calling Transparency:** The UI must be transparent about the AI's actions. When a function is triggered, a special "tool use" message will appear in the chat.

> **User Prompt:**
> `Summarize my chat with the "Project Team" and create a task for me to send the report.`
>
> **AI Response (Tool Use):**
> ✨ **Thinking...**
> * Using tool: `summarizeChat(chat: "Project Team")`
> * Using tool: `createTask(task: "Send the report")`
>
> **AI Response (Final Answer):**
> ✨ **Done! Here's the summary...**
> I've also added **"Send the report"** to your tasks.

## 5. Visual Language

* **Theme:** A clean, modern aesthetic with both **Light** and **Dark** modes.
* **Primary Color Palette:** Adhere to WhatsApp's green for familiarity in the core chat components.
* **AI Accent Color:** Use a distinct, vibrant color (e.g., **electric blue `#007BFF`** or **deep purple `#6F42C1`**) for all AI icons, buttons, and AI-generated message bubbles. This creates a clear visual distinction.
* **Icons:** Utilize a clean and consistent icon set (e.g., Lucide, Feather Icons).

## 6. Next Steps

1.  **Wireframing:** Create low-fidelity wireframes based on this plan using a tool like Figma or Balsamiq.
2.  **Prototyping:** Develop a high-fidelity, clickable prototype to test the user flow and AI interactions.
3.  **Component Development:** Begin building the individual UI components in Electron.
